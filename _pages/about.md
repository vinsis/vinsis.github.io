Hello there :wave:, I am Vinay Sisodia - currently working as a Machine Learning Tech Lead at PicCollage. I have deep interest in areas of math & machine learning. Other topics that interest me are education, natural languages and visualization. 

Things I have built
======
- [TinyVolt](https://tinyvolt.com/): A collection of interactive visual essays related to topics in math. Vastly inspired from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) and, to a certain extent, [Instill](https://distill.pub/).
- [Normalizing flows - theory and implementation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4RJUVHtEJXI_lpshcnnQMhHtMjrkwRyr): A YouTube playlist introducting the ideas behind normalizing flows and how to implement them in Python.
- [Distillation of CLIP model (Medium article)](https://medium.com/piccollage-astronauts/distillation-of-clip-model-and-other-experiments-f8394b7321ce): Done at PicCollage. The article covers only the initial attempt at distillation of the CLIP model. The work was then extended to extraction of attention values for image patches and re-training the distilled model with the attention values.
- [Category Theory Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/category-theory-enthusiasts/): A (now defunct) meetup group for discussing topics related to Category Theory. At some point I was really excited about this topic but soon realized that unless I familiarized myself with some advanced topics in abstract algebra, it would sound and feel like [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense). Incomplete notes on this topic can be found [here](https://github.com/vinsis/applied-category-theory-slides). 

I love taking notes
======
A small fraction of my notes can be found in these Github repos - [Understanding neural networks with PyTorch](https://github.com/vinsis/understanding-neuralnetworks-pytorch) and [Math and ML notes](https://github.com/vinsis/math-and-ml-notes/). I have been trying to organize them and put more of my notes in public domain.
